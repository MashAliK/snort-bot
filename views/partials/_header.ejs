                        <p>Snort is a turn-based game played by two players, referred to as <kbd>Black</kbd> and <kbd>White</kbd>, where the first player who cannot make a valid move is the loser. 
                            The game consists of a sequence of 'nodes' which are either unreserved, reserved by <kbd>Black</kbd>, or reserved by <kbd>White</kbd>. Unreserved nodes are drawn as small circles and reserved nodes are drawn as large circles corresponding to the color of the player that claimed the node.
                            Nodes which are connected by an edge between them are called adjacent nodes. The game begins by assigning a random player as the first player. During a turn, a player can play on one of the unreserved nodes or one of their own reserved nodes by clicking on it.
                            When a player moves at a node, that node dissapears and the adjacent nodes are reserved by that player. When two players reserve the same node it disappears. A player runs out of valid moves when there are no more unreserved nodes and no reserved nodes of their own color.
